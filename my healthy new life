3.26 It has been a long time that I restart a meditation.It's Saturday today,after playing the phone knowing about structure of kids health in the morning and recollect the dream about code and excellent work, I decided to have a meditation and found that 
     it's a way of thinking and a chance of clear your mind and provide a place to stay alone.
